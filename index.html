    <h1>How the Web Works</h1>
        <h2>In your own terms, define the following terms:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What is HTTP</li>
            <p>
                Hypertext Transfer Protocal, or how the servers and browsers communicate
            </p>
            <li>What is a URL?</li>
            <p>
                an address for some resourse
            </p>
            <li>What is DNS?</li>
            <p>
                Converts URLs into IP Addresses
            </p>
            <li>What is a query string?</li>
            <p>
                allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL
            </p>
            <li>What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?</li>
            <p>
                Get: gets data from servers / Post: Sends some data to servers
            </p>
            <li>What is an HTTP request?</li>
            <p>
                A request from a user to the server
            </p>
            <li>What is an HTTP response?</li>
            <p>
                the servers response to a users request
            </p>
            <li>What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.</li>
            <p>
                Provides additional info about the HTTP request, some examples are: last modified, host, cookies, content type
            </p>
            <li>What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?</li>
            <p>
                The browser turns the url into an IP address, then it makes a request to that IP address server, the server gives a response, the browser then generates a DOM from the server response
            </p>
        </ul>
